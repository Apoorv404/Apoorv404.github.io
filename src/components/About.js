      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a final Year Computer Science and Engineering (AI & ML) student passionate about
        solving problems with technology. I have worked on projects involving
        quantum machine learning, automation bots, and APIs.

        I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to build full stack
        applications. In my free time, I like reading science novels, playing
        harmonium, and exploring mobile games.
